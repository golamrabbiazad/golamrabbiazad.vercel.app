It's a year after I'm publishing a post.

So, the year 2022 was starting before I moved to Dhaka on <b>Nov 10, 2021, </b> to continue my Undergraduate program.
From then I was building my portfolio website project. When I was at half of my project I remember <b>Nov 23, 2021, </b> stole my MacBook Pro (early 2015) which my father bought for my undergraduate program.
Later I managed a PC to continue my journey.

On December 13, 2021, published the first version of my portfolio website project which is forked from <a href="https://leerob.io/">leerob.io</a>. yay 🥳 🎉

I have done a tour in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khulna">Khulna, Bangladesh</a> at the end of January 2022. I have stored the tour photos on my <a href="https://instagram.com/golamrabbiazad"> Instagram </a> account.

I did a contract-based job <b>(1 month)</b>. My role was Data Annotator which I had to complete 5 buckets (buckets containing 10 to 20 images, JSON files) per day I had to check and fix the error and create JSON files & sync with images.

I got a remote job offer in April 2022 from LinkedIn. This was my first remote job, and I didn't know about how remote jobs worked, how to handle clients, commit to projects, and sync project-client-project. I was to update about the project at everyday end of work.

30 hours per week as a <b>Core Developer</b> for building enterpise product.

- I got the job by submitting 3 as exercize projects(A React, Node.js, and vanilla projects).
- My task was to create drag & drop feature by extending <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/draggable">shopify draggable </a> API.
- I did the setup, configurations, and working basic drag & drop feature, and more to work to reach the project vision. <b>(give up)</b>

Project vision: (explaining soon)

<b>I left the job.</b>

I completed 3 years of the undergraduate program in September 2022. Expected to complete in 2023 🏆

I'm expanding my LinkedIn networks. Currently, 110+ people are connected with me. Please, if you want to <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/golamrabbiazad">join my network</a>

Tech I learned (remembering soon)

Done some side projects (sharing soon)

that's a wrap-up 2022.
